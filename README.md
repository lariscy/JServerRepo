# JServerRepo
Java client / server application for storage and launch of servers and URLs. Meant to be sort of like a combination of [Putty Connection Manager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/puttymanager/) and [Remote Desktop Manager](https://remotedesktopmanager.com/) with the added touch of acting like a storage for URL bookmarks.

##### List of modules:
* [client](https://github.com/lariscy/JServerRepo/tree/master/client) (JServerRepo-Client) - JavaFX desktop client
* [server](https://github.com/lariscy/JServerRepo/tree/master/server) (JServerRepo-Server) - Java server
* [shared](https://github.com/lariscy/JServerRepo/tree/master/shared) (JServerRepo-Shared) - Shared code for client and server modules
